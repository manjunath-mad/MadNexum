✅ **What’s improved:**
- Added **4-step roadmap** to show workflow clearly.  
- Added **Features section** to make it more appealing.  
- Added **How to Run** for basic instructions.  
- Markdown formatting is clean, so GitHub renders it nicely.

If you want, I can also **create a version with emojis and a visual roadmap diagram inline**, so your README itself **feels like a mini PPT slide**. It’ll look amazing for hackathons.  

Do you want me to do that next?
